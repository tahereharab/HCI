# Smart Subtitles for English Learning via Movie Watching
Final Project for Course CS2610 - INTERFACE DESIGN & EVALUATION
Watching English-spoken movies with subtitles is becoming increasingly popular throughout the world. 
One reason for this trend is the assumption that perceptual learning of the sounds of a foreign language 
namely English, will improve perception skills in non-English speakers. However, the traditional way of 
movie display cannot satisfy the learner’s requests anymore. This paper presents smart subtitles, which 
are interactive subtitles tailored towards vocabulary learning. This study provides English learners with 
a convenient video player in which upper-intermediate English words are highlighted in the shown subtitle 
along with their relevant Persian (Farsi) definitions at user’s request. Moreover, users can ask for the 
full translation of a dialog and also have access to the collection of the highlighted vocabularies in 
the end of a video. We analyze the challenges and feasibility of this approach and describe the outcomes 
of the user study we pilot with Persian native speakers who are English intermediate learners.
