2
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,570
Money, money, money. Hey!

3
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,204
You got a date with justice,
one-Eyed Bart.

4
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:23,207
Too bad, Sheriff. I 'm a married man.

5
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,377
One-Eyed Betty!

6
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,978
I think you dropped something, mister.

7
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,855
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!

8
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,440
You've reached the end of the line!

9
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,650
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

10
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,078
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!

11
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,042
Hate to leave early,
but our ride is here.

12
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,091
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

13
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,722
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

14
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,521
Hold him steady!

15
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,236
Woody, hurry!

16
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,758
No!

17
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,477
Glad I could catch the train!

18
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,813
Now let's catch some criminals.

19
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,399
To infinity and beyond!

20
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,084
Reach for the sky.

21
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,460
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

22
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,714
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

23
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,475
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

24
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,622
Evil Dr. Pork Chop!

25
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:17,506
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.

26
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,129
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."

27
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,090
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"

28
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,680
"You're going to jail, Bart."
"Watch out!"

29
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,934
Mom!

30
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,978
No, no, no. Just keep playing.Just pretend I 'm not here.

31
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,146
Oh,no, Molly!

32
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,983
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a fifty-foot baby from outer space.

33
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,778
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

34
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,031
Buster, get out of there. Does the red light mean it's going?

35
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,451
Come on. Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.

36
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,330
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.

37
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,040
Happy birthday!

38
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,002
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!

39
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,221
"I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"

40
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,931
"Got it, Woody."

41
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,767
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

42
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,020
"Good work, Buzz."

43
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,965
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

44
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,217
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

45
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,887
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.

46
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,806
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

47
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,100
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

48
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:37,521
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind squeezing next to you?

49
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,398
Is it hot in here?

50
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,483
Here they come!

51
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,237
Sarge, you got it?

52
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,697
Mission accomplished.

53
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,948
Hooray!

54
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,202
Careful. Careful!

55
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,707
All right, guys. We got one shot
at this. Everyone ready?

56
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,584
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

57
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,836
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

58
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,976
Target is on approach.

59
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,395
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

60
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,037
Hello?

61
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,541
Hello? Anyone there?

62
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,335
Molly, stay out of my room!

63
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,546
I wasn't in your room.

64
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,589
Then who was messing with my stuff?

65
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,049
It wasn't me.

66
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,724
Well, that went well.

67
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,769
He held me! He actually held me!

68
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,813
This is just sad.

69
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,315
Who we kiddin'?
The kid 's seventeen years old.

70
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,234
We ain't ever gettin' played with.

71
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,656
Guys, hey, hold up.

72
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,409
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

73
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,660
Not again!

74
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,830
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.

75
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
We are gathered, Woody.

76
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,834
Okay. First off,

77
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,963
we all knew operation Playtime was a long shot.

78
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,464
More like a misfire.

79
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:31,510
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

80
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,721
Being there for Andy. We know.

81
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,347
But we can try again! Right?

82
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,768
I 'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

83
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,020
What?

84
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,607
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.

85
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,984
We're going into attic mode, folks.

86
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,902
Keep your accessories with you at all times.

87
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,031
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

88
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,659
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

89
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,454
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

90
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,623
Yeah, but now it's here.

91
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,042
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

92
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,460
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

93
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,172
War's over, folks.Me and the boys are moving on.

94
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,299
- Moving on?
- You're going AWoL?

95
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,177
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

96
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,512
And let's face it,when the trash bags come out,

97
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,264
we army guys are the first to go.

98
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,892
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

99
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:24,104
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.
